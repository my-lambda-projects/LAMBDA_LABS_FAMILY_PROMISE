# Getting Started

### User Flows

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/FyWvcZzY/family-promise-of-spokane)

Each user should have one associated role determining which features are available to them. Flows should be designed to accommodate the addition of more user roles in the future.

Our product supported the following user roles:

- Executive Director
- Supervisor: Responsible for handling the day-to-day needs of the guests at the shelter, including conducting intakes of new families.
- Case Manager: Writes case notes on guests the shelter is serving as they work with them.
- Guest : A "head of household" arriving to or checked into the shelter as part of a family unit of some kind.

and the following user stories:

- All users should be able to view and update a user profile.
- Guests should be able to check in to the shelter using a form. This form should be as simple and user-friendly as possible. We need to distinguish new guests from returning guests and log the check-in accordingly.
- New guests should have a profile created for them.
- Supervisors should be able to view all guests currently checked into the shelter.
- Case Managers should be able to look up guests and log notes associated with ongoing case management.
- Case Managers should be able to view and edit and Guests should be able to view those notes. Entries should be confidential between the case manager and the guest.

### Key Features

- Supervisors can Create guest profile
- Case Manager can view guest profile
- Case Manager can view the exit destination prediction
- Guest can be flagged for mis conduct
- notes can be added to guest's profile.
- Guest can view their own profile.
